                <p style="font-size: 20px;">We evolve through learning. Our objective is to make all the learning material available at the ease of fingertips. So students donâ€™t have to go anywhere else to solve their doubts. They can practice at their own pace, first filling in gaps in their understanding and then accelerating their learning. This will also provide ease of time, as they can easily access the content at any time. <br> <br> SemBooster is our model for Prayas, where we aim to provide free, easily accessible learning material to all. The front end of this website is designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also a popular CSS framework Bootstrap. The Django framework in Python language was utilized for developing the back end. The database management system used here is PostgreSQL and Git was used as version control software. The progress of this entire project was closely monitored by our mentor, Ms. Monalisa. Without her expert guidance it would have been impossible for us to successfully execute this project.</p>
